SecureRSA: Strengthening Chat Communication through RSA Encryption
The RSA Encryption algorithm, widely used in e-commerce, e-mail services, telecommunications, and other applications, is implemented to safeguard the confidentiality of communication. Although the application follows a server-client interaction model, the goal is to deploy it for broader use cases, expanding its usability beyond conventional scenarios. Combining user-friendly features and strong encryption, the Chat application aims to provide a secure and interactive communication platform for various purposes.
